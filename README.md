# Artificial Neural Network 
In this repo, Artificial Neural Networks Lab Session Experiments are being Uploaded. In this repo, you can find various concepts for ANN are implemented using Python and NumPy. 
Artificial Neural Networks works on basis of neurons i.e. to mimic brain. In this practicals I have performed Learning rules, Activation functions, region of convergence, Back propagation, Neural Network as Memory.

# Introduction to Fuzzy Logic
One basic program for set operation is performed which is in github repository
